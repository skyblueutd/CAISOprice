# CAISOprice
It is a LSTM program to predict the price of electricity in california. Open source data was collected from CAISO. 
The real situation must be more complicated than this. Please refer to this github link to read more about deep learning teches on predicating stock price. I learned a lot from it.

There is also a paper in 2019 named "Knowledge-Driven Stock Trend Prediction and Explanation via Temporal Convolutional Network" which shows the real light for stock prediction.

There is a new tool (NeuralProphet) with Pytorch for time series forecasting. It seems it is not a GAN though it is helpful.

I can not find a way to do multi-variable time series prediction with NeuralProphet... But I find a way to do that with LSTM(Keras)
